# Baseline comparison sweep — methodology reference

This is the local source of truth for how baseline performance clouds are
produced and interpreted in this repo. The sweep script is
[scripts/experiments/baseline_cloud_sweep.py](scripts/experiments/baseline_cloud_sweep.py).
It supports two views. Keep the two views separate — they answer different
questions and the artifacts are stored in different output subfolders.

## Two views

### Regime view (`--view regime`, default, main comparison)

Sweep shared **system regime** inputs `(Λ, wr)` on a small grid. Every
baseline sees the same grid and re-optimizes at its own library defaults.
Each cloud point means:

> "method M's best design at system regime `(Λ, wr)`"

All clouds live in the same plane, use the same x-/y-axis semantics, and are
directly comparable.

Default grid: `Λ ∈ {50, 150, 300}` pax/hour, `wr ∈ {0.3, 1.0, 3.0}` →
9 points per baseline. Change with `--regime_lambdas` and `--regime_wrs`.

### Hyper view (`--view hyper`, diagnostic)

Sweep per-baseline hyperparameters (fleet for FR, `T_fixed` for SP-Lit,
`num_districts` for Joint, walk-tolerance for VCC, …). Useful to see each
method's own Pareto shape and to understand how its hyperparameters bend
the frontier. **Not apples-to-apples across baselines** — different methods
sweep different knobs, span different axes of the cost plane, and live in
different absolute ranges. Use this view for single-method diagnostics, not
for cross-method claims.

## Shared-parameter definitions

These semantics are assumed by both views and are the authoritative contract
between baselines and the sweep harness. If a future change touches any of
these, update this file.

### `Λ` — total arrival rate `[passengers / hour]`

- Poisson arrival rate summed over the whole service area.
- Spatial distribution is fixed by `prob_dict`, so the per-block rate is
  `Λ · p_b`.
- **System input, not a design choice.** Every baseline receives the same
  `Λ` via `design(..., Lambda=Λ)` and `evaluate(..., Lambda=Λ)` and must
  design a service that handles it. No baseline rescales `Λ` internally.

### `wr` — rider time cost weight `[cost / rider-hour]`

- Weight on total user time (`wait + in-vehicle + walk`) in the design
  objective and in the reported `EvaluationResult.user_cost =
  wr · total_user_time_per_rider · expected demand`.
- Used by `_newton_T_star` ([lib/baselines/base.py:157](lib/baselines/base.py))
  for every partition baseline that picks `T*` automatically.

### `wv` — vehicle operating cost weight `[cost / vehicle-km]`

- **Pinned to `1.0` in regime view.**
- Intended meaning: cost of one vehicle-km of provider travel
  (linehaul + in-district + detour).
- Do not interpret `wv` as vehicle speed. Physical speed is a separate model
  constant.
- In `FRDetour`, rider wait and in-vehicle time should both be weighted by
  `wr`; `wv` is only a provider-side cost scale there.
- **Known asymmetry**: the optimization side uses `wv` explicitly
  (`_newton_T_star` at [lib/baselines/base.py:174](lib/baselines/base.py);
  the FR-Detour master at [lib/baselines/fr_detour.py:894](lib/baselines/fr_detour.py)),
  but the evaluation side builds
  `provider_cost = linehaul_km + in_district_km + odd + fleet_cost_rate · raw_fleet`
  **without multiplying by `wv`** ([lib/baselines/base.py:645,651](lib/baselines/base.py)).
  The evaluation implicitly assumes `wv = 1 [cost / km]`, while the
  optimizer uses whatever `wv` you pass. Fixing `wv = 1` in regime view
  keeps both sides on the same scale. Do not sweep `wv` unless the
  `evaluate_design` / `simulate_design` helpers are fixed first.

## Regime-responsiveness at design time

Not every baseline re-optimizes its design when `(Λ, wr)` changes. This
cheat sheet tells you what to expect:

| Baseline | Design uses `Λ` | Design uses `wr`/`wv` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Multi-FR / Multi-FR-Detour | yes | yes | Benders master; `T` over internal `T_values` grid |
| SP-Lit (Carlsson) | no | no | Fixed `T_fixed` → **regime-insensitive design** |
| TP-Lit (Liu) | yes | partial | Uses `Λ·T` for fleet sizing |
| Joint-Nom / Joint-DRO | yes | yes | Newton `T*` uses `wr/wv` |
| VCC | yes | no | `Λ` drives planning horizon only |
| OD (FullyOD) | no | no | Fixed `T_min` → **regime-insensitive design** |

For regime-insensitive designs the cloud answers "how does this fixed
design behave when the world around it changes" — a legitimate data point
and explicitly called out in the regime-view `varying_note` for that
baseline. Do **not** describe them as if they were re-optimizing.

### Fleet-size parity across baselines

Regime view is set up so baselines with **scheduled** vehicles all operate
at roughly the same fleet scale, tied to `--districts`:

- Partition methods (SP-Lit, Joint-Nom, Joint-DRO) dispatch one tour per
  district, so their effective fleet is ≈ `K = --districts` (maybe +1 per
  district if utilization exceeds one vehicle-period).
- FR / FR-Detour: `max_fleet` is deliberately left unset in
  `_build_regime_specs`, so the `FRDetour` constructor's fall-back
  (`fleet_budget = num_districts`, see
  [lib/baselines/fr_detour.py:2351](lib/baselines/fr_detour.py)) gives FR
  exactly `K` vehicles. This matches SP-Lit's fleet footprint and makes
  FR vs partition a routing-structure comparison, not a fleet-scale one.

Baselines with **unscheduled** vehicles do NOT fit this parity rule and
are on a different fleet axis by design:

- OD: fully on-demand; every request can trigger its own vehicle. Its
  effective fleet is whatever the simulation draws, typically ≫ K.
- VCC: currently hardcoded `fleet_size = 30` in `_build_regime_specs`.
  This is NOT comparable to partition/FR on the fleet axis — VCC at `K=3`
  vehicles would be broken (the DAR-VCC model assumes enough vehicles to
  absorb request overlap with walk-tolerance slack). Treat VCC cloud
  position as "VCC at its own scale" and not a direct fleet-for-fleet
  comparison with SP-Lit or FR.

When you add a new scheduled baseline, wire it through the same
`num_districts` → fleet-budget default so the fleet-parity rule holds.

### Cost-weight interpretation for `wr`

There is a known asymmetry in how `wr` enters the design objective
across baselines. The two conventions coexist in the codebase:

**Per-rider convention** (Joint-Nom, Joint-DRO, SP-Lit):
  The Newton `T*` formula uses `wr · T` as the wait-cost term — cost
  for **one rider** waiting `T` hours. `Λ` enters the objective only
  indirectly through the BHH tour term `α_i = β · √Λ · ...`, not
  through the wait term. This follows the continuous-approximation
  literature's per-district normalisation.

**Aggregate convention** (Multi-FR, OD, VCC):
  - Multi-FR's Benders master objective includes
    `wr · T/2 · expected_demand · z`, which is **aggregate** wait cost
    across all riders assigned to a trip.
  - OD and VCC use aggregate cost `provider + wr · user_time · Λ` as
    the **selection criterion** when sweeping over fleet-size candidates.
    This is a post-hoc selection rule, not part of the original
    optimisation — the simulation itself still reports per-rider metrics.

**Consequence**: partition methods' `T*` responds weakly to `Λ` in the
wait dimension (only via `√Λ` in the tour), while FR's `T*` responds
strongly (`T* ∝ 1/√Λ` from the aggregate wait term). This is visible
in the cloud: FR's user time **decreases** with `Λ` (economies of
density on fixed routes), while Joint's barely changes.

This asymmetry is **documented, not a bug to be fixed immediately**.
It reflects a genuine difference in service-design philosophy:
per-rider fairness (partition) vs system-wide efficiency (FR/OD/VCC).
Aligning them would require changing either the CA literature's
normalisation or FR's Benders objective, both of which have downstream
implications. For now, interpret the cloud comparison with this
asymmetry in mind.

## Cloud interpretation

### Regime view
- Each baseline produces `|Λ| × |wr|` points (default 9).
- Marker **size ∝ Λ** (small = smallest Λ, large = largest Λ).
- Marker **color/shape = baseline** (fixed per-method styling).
- The convex hull of points is drawn lightly to show each method's spread
  across the regime grid.
- Comparing two clouds directly is valid.

### Hyper view
- Each baseline produces up to `--settings_per_baseline` points (default 20).
- Marker size is uniform; shape/color identifies the baseline.
- The hull shape depends entirely on which hyperparameter axis each method
  sweeps — NOT a Pareto frontier across methods. Treat the hulls as
  per-method shapes, not as comparable regions.
- Do **not** sweep Joint-DRO's `epsilon` in the cloud — it is a robustness
  knob, not a provider-vs-user Pareto knob. The current script drops it
  from the cloud automatically; put it in a dedicated robustness plot
  instead.

## Output layout

`results/baseline_clouds/<view>_<mode>_<descriptor>_K<K>_L<Λ>_wr<wr>_wv<wv>_cloud_<timestamp>/`

- `experiment.json` — sweep metadata, including `view`, `regime_lambdas`,
  `regime_wrs`, the pinned `wv`, and each baseline's `varying_note`.
- `aggregate_results.json` — all rows + metadata.
- `aggregate_summary.csv` — flat CSV; `Lambda` and `wr` columns are always
  populated so rows are self-describing regardless of view.
- `scatter_user_provider_cloud.png` — the main plot.
- `<baseline_slug>/`
  - `settings.json` — the sweep settings for this baseline.
  - `summary.csv`
  - `setting_01.json … setting_NN.json` — per-setting cache. `--resume`
    reuses these without recomputing, so the same output folder can be
    iterated on.

## Adding a new baseline

To make a new baseline work cleanly under the regime view, its `design(...)`
method must:

1. **Accept `Lambda`, `wr`, `wv` via kwargs**. The base abstract method is
   keyword-only for these; the concrete baselines already follow this
   pattern (e.g. [lib/baselines/fr_detour.py:2297](lib/baselines/fr_detour.py)).
2. **Use them internally** when choosing its design (through
   `_newton_T_star`, its own MIP objective, or whatever mechanism is
   appropriate). A baseline that ignores `Λ`, `wr`, `wv` will produce an
   identical design across the whole regime grid — still plottable, but
   must be marked `regime-insensitive design` in the cheat-sheet above and
   in the baseline's `varying_note` string in `_build_regime_specs`.
3. **Populate the mode-appropriate slots** of `EvaluationResult`. Follow the
   mode-specific cost-structure rule from
   [.claude/CLAUDE.md](.claude/CLAUDE.md) — do not inherit cost components
   that do not operationally belong to the mode.

## What NOT to do

- Do not sweep `wv` unless `evaluate_design` / `simulate_design` are fixed
  to multiply `provider_cost` by `wv`. The asymmetry above is a known
  limitation; pin `wv = 1` until it is actually fixed.
- Do not put Joint-DRO's `epsilon` in the main cloud. Separate robustness
  plot.
- Do not compare hull areas across hyper-view baselines and call it a
  comparison — that is exactly what the regime view was added to fix.
- Do not silently add a new regime knob (e.g. `K`, `fleet_cost_rate`) to
  the grid. If you want to study `K` sensitivity, run separate sweeps per
  `K` and compare as a small multiple, not by blowing up the single cloud
  plot.
